# Novel Content Formatting Guide for R2 Upload

This skill provides the file structure and format specifications for preparing novel content to be uploaded to Cloudflare R2 buckets for web novel viewer applications.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- User asks how to format novel content for upload
- User needs to prepare chapters, metadata, or cover art
- User wants to upload content to R2
- User asks about the structure of `meta.json`
- User needs validation rules for novel content
- User asks about chapter numbering or file formats

## R2 Directory Structure

Each novel MUST follow this exact structure in R2:

```
novels/
└── {novel-slug}/
    ├── meta.json
    ├── chapters/
    │   ├── 00001.md
    │   ├── 00002.md
    │   ├── 00003.md
    │   └── ... (continue numbering)
    └── assets/
        └── cover_art.{jpg|png|webp}
```

### Path Conventions

- **Novel slug**: Use kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens). Example: `the-wandering-immortal`, `sword-masters-journey`
- **Chapter numbering**: Zero-padded 5-digit numbers (`00001`, `00002`, ..., `99999`)
- **Cover art**: Must be named `cover_art` with a supported extension (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.webp`)

## `meta.json` Format

Each novel MUST have a `meta.json` file at `novels/{novel-slug}/meta.json` with the following structure:

```json
{
  "title": "The Wandering Immortal",
  "author": "Author Name",
  "description": "A captivating story of cultivation and adventure. This description appears on novel cards and the detail page. Keep it concise but compelling (2-3 sentences recommended).",
  "status": "ongoing",
  "genre": ["fantasy", "cultivation"],
  "tags": ["reincarnation", "magic-system", "weak-to-strong"],
  "language": "en",
  "publishedAt": "2024-01-15",
  "updatedAt": "2024-12-01"
}
```

### Field Specifications

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `title` | `string` | ✅ Required | The novel's display title |
| `author` | `string` | ✅ Required | Author's name or pen name |
| `description` | `string` | ✅ Required | Brief synopsis shown in novel cards and detail page. 2-3 sentences recommended. |
| `status` | `enum` | ✅ Required | Must be one of: `"ongoing"`, `"completed"`, `"hiatus"` |
| `genre` | `string[]` | ✅ Required | Array of genre tags (lowercase, kebab-case). Examples: `"fantasy"`, `"sci-fi"`, `"romance"`, `"mystery"`, `"slice-of-life"` |
| `tags` | `string[]` | ⚠️ Optional | Additional descriptive tags (lowercase, kebab-case). Examples: `"reincarnation"`, `"time-travel"`, `"magic-system"`, `"weak-to-strong"` |
| `language` | `string` | ✅ Required | ISO 639-1 language code. Examples: `"en"`, `"es"`, `"zh"`, `"ja"` |
| `publishedAt` | `string` | ✅ Required | ISO 8601 date when the novel was first published. Format: `YYYY-MM-DD` |
| `updatedAt` | `string` | ✅ Required | ISO 8601 date of the last chapter update. Format: `YYYY-MM-DD` |

### Example `meta.json` Files

**Fantasy Novel:**
```json
{
  "title": "Sword Master's Journey",
  "author": "Wei Chen",
  "description": "A young blacksmith discovers an ancient sword technique that sets him on a path to become the greatest sword master in history. But power comes with a price.",
  "status": "ongoing",
  "genre": ["fantasy", "action", "cultivation"],
  "tags": ["swords", "martial-arts", "weak-to-strong", "master-disciple"],
  "language": "en",
  "publishedAt": "2025-03-12",

}
```

  "language": "en",
  "publishedAt": "2024-06-01",
  "updatedAt": "2025-11-30"
}
```

## Chapter File Format (`.md`)

Each chapter file is a Markdown document with optional YAML frontmatter.

### File Path
`novels/{novel-slug}/chapters/{chapter-number}.md`

Example: `novels/the-wandering-immortal/chapters/00001.md`

### Frontmatter (Optional)

```yaml
---
title: The Awakening
---
```

- **`title`** (optional): Human-readable chapter title. If omitted, the reader will display "Chapter {number}" (e.g., "Chapter 1")

### Chapter Content

The chapter body is standard Markdown. Supported elements:

- **Headings**: `#`, `##`, `###` (avoid using `#` as it conflicts with the chapter title)
- **Paragraphs**: Separate with blank lines
- **Emphasis**: `*italic*`, `**bold**`
- **Lists**: Unordered (`-`) and ordered (`1.`)
- **Blockquotes**: `> quoted text`
- **Code blocks**: Triple backticks
- **Horizontal rules**: `---`

**Do NOT use:**
- Inline HTML (it will be rendered as text for security)
- Embedded images (use descriptive text instead)
- External links (or use with caution)

### Example Chapter File

**`novels/my-novel/chapters/00001.md`:**
```markdown
---
title: The Awakening
---

The morning sun crept through the wooden shutters, casting long shadows across the dusty workshop floor. Li Wei sat cross-legged on the cold stone, his eyes closed in meditation.

He had been practicing the *Iron Body Technique* for three years now, but today felt different. The qi flowing through his meridians moved with an unfamiliar intensity.

"Focus," he whispered to himself. "It's almost time."

## The Breakthrough

As the sun reached its zenith, Li Wei felt a sudden surge of energy. His body began to tremble—not from weakness, but from an overwhelming power awakening within.

This was the moment he had been waiting for.

*To be continued...*
```

## Cover Art Requirements

### File Specifications
- **Path**: `novels/{novel-slug}/assets/cover_art.{extension}`
- **Supported formats**: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp`
- **Recommended dimensions**: 800x1200px (2:3 aspect ratio) minimum
- **File size**: Under 500KB recommended for fast loading
- **Quality**: High-quality, legible at thumbnail sizes

### Naming Convention
The file MUST be named exactly `cover_art` with a supported extension:
- ✅ `cover_art.jpg`
- ✅ `cover_art.png`
- ✅ `cover_art.webp`
- ❌ `cover.jpg` (incorrect name)
- ❌ `cover_art_v2.png` (no suffixes allowed)

If no cover art is provided, the viewer will display a placeholder with the novel's initials.

## R2 Upload Methods

### Using Wrangler CLI

```bash
# Upload meta.json
wrangler r2 object put YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/novels/my-novel/meta.json --file=./meta.json --remote

# Upload a chapter
wrangler r2 object put YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/novels/my-novel/chapters/00001.md --file=./chapters/00001.md --remote

# Upload cover art
wrangler r2 object put YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/novels/my-novel/assets/cover_art.jpg --file=./cover_art.jpg --remote
```

### Bulk Upload Script Example

```bash
#!/bin/bash
NOVEL_SLUG="my-novel"
BUCKET="YOUR_BUCKET_NAME"  # Replace with your R2 bucket name

# Upload meta
wrangler r2 object put $BUCKET/novels/$NOVEL_SLUG/meta.json --file=./meta.json --remote

# Upload all chapters
for chapter in chapters/*.md; do
  filename=$(basename "$chapter")
  wrangler r2 object put $BUCKET/novels/$NOVEL_SLUG/chapters/$filename --file="$chapter" --remote
done

# Upload cover art
wrangler r2 object put $BUCKET/novels/$NOVEL_SLUG/assets/cover_art.jpg --file=./cover_art.jpg --remote
```

## Validation Tips

### Validate JSON
Before uploading, validate your `meta.json`:
```bash
# Using jq
jq empty meta.json && echo "Valid JSON" || echo "Invalid JSON"
```

### Validate Markdown
Test your Markdown renders correctly using any Markdown preview tool before uploading.

### Check File Names
Ensure chapter numbering is sequential and zero-padded:
```bash
# List chapter files
ls -1 chapters/ | sort
# Expected output:
# 00001.md
# 00002.md
# 00003.md
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. ❌ Using spaces in the novel slug → ✅ Use hyphens instead
2. ❌ Chapter files like `1.md`, `2.md` → ✅ Use `00001.md`, `00002.md`
3. ❌ Missing required fields in `meta.json` → ✅ Double-check all required fields
4. ❌ Using incorrect status values → ✅ Only use: `ongoing`, `completed`, `hiatus`
5. ❌ Cover art with wrong name → ✅ Must be named `cover_art.{ext}`
6. ❌ HTML tags in Markdown → ✅ Use pure Markdown syntax
7. ❌ Inconsistent date formats → ✅ Always use `YYYY-MM-DD`

## Quick Reference Card

```
Structure:
  novels/{slug}/meta.json
  novels/{slug}/chapters/00001.md
  novels/{slug}/assets/cover_art.jpg

meta.json required fields:
  title, author, description, status, genre, language, publishedAt, updatedAt

Chapter frontmatter (optional):
  ---
  title: Chapter Title Here
  ---

Status values:
  "ongoing" | "completed" | "hiatus"
```

## AI Agent Usage Instructions

When helping users format content:

1. **Validate the structure** — Check that all required paths and files are present
2. **Generate meta.json** — Ask user for novel details and generate a valid `meta.json`
3. **Format chapters** — Help convert raw text to properly formatted markdown with frontmatter
4. **Create upload script** — Generate a bulk upload script for the user's specific novel
5. **Validate before upload** — Run through the checklist above

**Output Format**: Always provide ready-to-use files and scripts. Don't just explain — generate the actual content the user needs.
